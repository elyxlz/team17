Here's the suggested modification:\n\nReplace lines: 65-67\n```python\n    def _is_silent(self, waveform: torch.Tensor) -> bool:\n        # Calculate RMS for each sample\n        rms = torch.sqrt(torch.mean(waveform**2, dim=0))\n        # Count samples below silence threshold\n        silent_samples = torch.sum(rms < self.silence_threshold)\n        # Consider silent if 90% or more samples are below threshold\n        return (silent_samples / rms.shape[0]) >= 0.9\n```\n\nThis modification changes the `_is_silent` method to:\n1. Calculate the RMS for each sample in the waveform.\n2. Count how many samples have an RMS below the silence threshold.\n3. Return True if 90% or more of the samples are below the threshold.\n\nThis approach ensures that the method returns True even if only 90% of the audio is silent, as requested in the question.", "request": "sohuld return silent even if only 90% of the audio is silent"}]
