The `LOSSFUNCTION` enum is not defined, and it should be `LossFunction` instead. Additionally, we should use the enum value `CrossEntropy` instead of `CE`. Here's the suggested modification:\n\nReplace lines: 120-120\n```python\n    model.set_loss_config(LossConfig(LossFunction.CrossEntropy))\n```\n\nThis change is necessary because:\n1. The correct enum name is `LossFunction`, not `LOSSFUNCTION`.\n2. The enum value for cross-entropy loss is `CrossEntropy`, not `CE`.\n\nThis modification will ensure that the loss configuration is set correctly using the proper enum and value.", "request": "help"}]
