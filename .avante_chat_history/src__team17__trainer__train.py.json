The `LOSSFUNCTION` enum is not defined, and it should be `LossFunction` instead. Additionally, we should use the enum value `CrossEntropy` instead of `CE`. Here's the suggested modification:\n\nReplace lines: 120-120\n```python\n    model.set_loss_config(LossConfig(LossFunction.CrossEntropy))\n```\n\nThis change is necessary because:\n1. The correct enum name is `LossFunction`, not `LOSSFUNCTION`.\n2. The enum value for cross-entropy loss is `CrossEntropy`, not `CE`.\n\nThis modification will ensure that the loss configuration is set correctly using the proper enum and value.", "request": "help"}, {"provider": "claude", "timestamp": "2024-11-23 11:08:08", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", "response": "To fix the issue in the provided code, we need to make the following change:\n\nReplace lines: 47-48\n```python\n    if config.ultravox_pretrained_path is not None:\n        config = UltravoxConfig.from_pretrained(config.ultravox_pretrained_path)\n```\n\nThis change is necessary because:\n1.
